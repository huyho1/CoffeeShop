This program prompts the user to enter an int for seed, int for total minutes
of simulation, float for probability of someone entering the shop, float for
probability that someone is done ordering from the shop, int for how many
cashiers there are and an output file. 

Then it will simulate the coffee shop during that time period and put the results
into the output file for you.

To compile the program, run the command:
make

To run the program, run the command:
./run_simulation int1 int2 float1 float2 int3 output1.txt
